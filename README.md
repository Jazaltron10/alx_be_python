## 📋 Tasks Overview

### 🧮 0. Basic Arithmetic Exercise
**Objective**: Practice basic arithmetic operations in Python.

**Instructions**:
- Create `basic_operations.py`.
- Define `number1` and `number2` with values `10` and `5`.
- Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
- Print results in the format: `[operation] of [number1] and [number2] is [result]`.

**Expected Output**:
```plaintext
Addition of 10 and 5 is 15
Subtraction of 10 and 5 is 5
Multiplication of 10 and 5 is 50
```

### 💰 1. Simple Interest Calculator
**Objective**: Calculate simple interest using arithmetic operations.

**Instructions**:
- Create `simple_interest.py`.
- Define `principal = 1000`, `rate = 0.05`, `time = 3`.
- Calculate simple interest: `I = P * R * T`.
- Print result: `The simple interest is: [interest]`.

**Expected Output**:
```plaintext
The simple interest is: 150.0
```

### 📐 2. Calculate the Area of a Rectangle
**Objective**: Calculate the area of a rectangle using length and width.

**Instructions**:
- Create `rectangle_area.py`.
- Define `length = 10` and `width = 5`.
- Calculate area: `Area = length * width`.
- Print result: `The area of the rectangle is: [area]`.

**Expected Output**:
```plaintext
The area of the rectangle is: 50
```

### ⏳ 3. Convert Hours to Seconds
**Objective**: Convert hours to seconds.

**Instructions**:
- Create `hours_to_seconds.py`.
- Define `hours = 2`.
- Calculate seconds: `seconds = hours * 3600`.
- Print result: `[hours] hour(s) is [seconds] seconds`.

**Expected Output**:
```plaintext
2 hour(s) is 7200 seconds
```

### 👶 4. User Input Age Calculator
**Objective**: Calculate user's age in a future year based on current age input.

**Instructions**:
- Create `future_age_calculator.py`.
- Prompt user for current age.
- Calculate age in 2050 (assuming current year is 2023).
- Print result: `In 2050, you will be [age] years old`.

**Expected Output**:
```plaintext
In 2050, you will be [age] years old
```

### 💸 5. Personal Finance Calculator (Advanced)
**Objective**: Calculate monthly savings and project annual savings with interest.

**Instructions**:
- Create `finance_calculator.py`.
- Prompt user for monthly income and expenses.
- Calculate monthly savings: `Monthly Savings = Income - Expenses`.
- Project annual savings with 5% interest.
- Print results.

**Expected Output**:
```plaintext
Your monthly savings are $[savings].
Projected savings after one year, with interest, is: $[projected_savings].
```
